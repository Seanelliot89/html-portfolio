<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Braveheart.jpg" height="200" alt="Braveheart"/>
<p>Current working as a Senior Operations Manager (Very Badly But I Love It), I spend most of my days
  looking at Windows, dealing with staff who dont show up to work and Driving around London listing to Taylor Swift!
</p>

<p>If I am not at work then I will be at home, pulling my hair out and having a panic attack because my 4 children are pushing me to the limit.
  Football on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays keeps me sane, along with my PS5.
  My inability to relax means I am constantly trying to earn money, learn things or fix(Make Even Worse) things around the house.
</p>

<p>In 2020 I started learning how to code, however it very quickly turned into a Web Business that took up all my time for very little money.
  However, I am absolutley determined to finish this course, start the Pyhton Course and build some serious apps. Oh, I also enrolled on the Swift Course, but I guess I'm trying to do too much!
  Heres to the next 6 months of trying to crack coding and actually achieve and finish something I started a LONGGG TIMEE AGOO!
